# Lil Microfiction Generator  📚⭐🏀




This lil' microfiction generator was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and uses words from dariusk's ["corpora" repository](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora). Every time you click the big purple button, it tells a randomly-generated story about Academia 📚, Hollywood ⭐, or the NBA 🏀 that features different animals, interjections, celebrities, athletes, and--most importantly--tasty food items 🥑🦐🍟, drawn from the 1000 most frequently appearing menu items from the New York Public Library's ["What's on the menu?" project](http://menus.nypl.org/data) (1850s-present). Every story concludes with either a quotation from a famous movie/book, from William Shakespeare, or from Oprah Winfrey.

With this microficton generator, you--yes, you, gentle user!--can simultaneously read *and* write thousands of new stories that have never been read or told before. Happy story-telling!
